README:

vgg_net_19_specs.txt - description of the layers for 44 layers of VGG-19

constants.m - file to set up all constants for the implementation

get_style.m - function to obtain the style matrix from an activation layer
get_contentGrad.m - function to obtain the gradient of error with respect to the activation layer for content
get_styleGrad.m - function to obtain the gradient of error with respect to the activation layer for style

initialize.m - script to load required images and VGG-network
optimize.m - function to perform a single iteration of gradient descent using gradients for both style and content
run.m - script to call initialize.m and perform gradient descent to render required image
